<h4> PUTTING ON YOUR SHOES </h4>

<div id="outcome0" style="display: none;">

  <p>
    You made it to class <span> late.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    The professor is fed up with your tardy and makes a scene in front of the class.

  </p>

  <p>
    <em> "Why is it so hard to make it to class on time? I live an hour from campus and never have an issue being here at 9." </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, deep down you know his dated 20th-century views are <span> foolish.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    He clearly must not realize kids hate college these days. Getting to class is a chore.
  </p>

  <p>
    At least you put on your shoes.
  </p>

  <p>
    You take out your laptop and carry on with your boring day.
  </p>

</div>

<div id="outcome1" style="display: none;">

  <p>
    You made it to campus at <span> 8:52am.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    After entering the lecture building, you head over to grab something from the vending machine.
  </p>

  <p>
    In front of you is the school's second most popular cheerleader. You definitely have a chance with her.
  </p>

  <p>
    She steps aside.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em> "Go ahead, my card is tweaking." </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    You look at the unappealing options and settle on D6. You let the girl know that the <span> breakfast biscuit</span> is not the only snack on your mind and ask for her number.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em> I am flattered. My number is three-one-two, nine-nine-six, seventy-one forty.</em>
  </p>

  <p> You jot her number and tell her you hope to see her again.</p>

  <p>
    You slowly walk to lecture, feeling good about yourself. 
  </p>

</div>

<div id="outcome2" style="display: none;">

  <p>
    You made it to campus at <span> 8:52am.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    After entering the lecture building, you head over to grab something from the vending machine.
  </p>

  <p>
    In front of you is the school's second most popular cheerleader. You definitely have a chance with her.
  </p>

  <p>
    She steps aside.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em> "Go ahead, my card is tweaking." </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    You look at the unappealing options and settle on F4. You let the girl know that the <span>bag of chips</span> is not the only snack on your mind and ask for her number.
  </p>

  <p>
    She gives you an odd stare and glances at your <span>Yeezys. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <em> No thanks, I have a boyfriend. </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    This cannot be true. You hesitate before telling her you have Kanye's latest and greatest.
  </p>

  <p>
    She <span> laughs </span> and starts talking to her friends, who have been casually listening. 
  </p>

  <p>
    As you walk away, you overhear them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> "What a clown, Yeezys have been bricks for years." </em>
  </p>

  <p> You have a hard time getting over it and slowly walk away.</p>



</div>

<div id="outcome3" style="display: none;">

  <p>
    After lacing for five minutes, You made it to campus at <span> 8:56am.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    After entering the lecture building, you head over to grab something from the vending machine.
  </p>

  <p>
    In front of you is that quirky girl from your Earth Science lecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you approach the vending machine she looks at you.
  </p>

  <p>
    You want to talk to her.
  </p>

  <p>
    But then you glance at your <span> shoes.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    You look like a New England social media influencer. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Will it make a difference? First impressions count.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before you make up your mind, she starts to walk your way.
  </p>

  <p>
    You hesitate and decide against it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eager to get to class on time, you walk up to the machine and buy a snack.
